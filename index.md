## About Me

Hi! I am Mingran, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL, advised by [Prof. Manya Ghobadi](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ghobadi/). <br>
Prior to joining MIT, I received my bachelor's degree from Fudan University and master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University. During my master, I was advised by [Prof. Vyas Sekar](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vsekar/). <br>
My research interests include systems and networking, with a particular emphasis on developing innovative network systems for machine learning applications. I am a recipient of [2022 Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/2022-recipients/) and [MIT Presidential Fellowship](https://web.mit.edu/provost/presfellow/).
